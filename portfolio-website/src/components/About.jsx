              I am a full stack developer and healthcare professional with a
              passion for technology and web development. With 5-6 years of
              experience in healthcare roles and a background in coding, design,
              and marketing through my position as a floral designer and social
              media coordinator at a small business flower shop, I am driven by
              problem-solving and the ever-expanding realm of technology.
              Specializing in front-end and back-end web development, I combine
              technical skills with a keen eye for design to deliver exceptional
              user experiences. With recent proficiency in JavaScript, ReactJS,
              HTML, Chakra UI, Bootstrap, and CSS, I am focused on becoming a
              proficient web developer and creating innovative, visually
              captivating websites. I eagerly seek opportunities to connect,
              network, and collaborate with like-minded individuals, fostering a
              community of growth and learning while exploring new avenues for
              educational and professional development.
